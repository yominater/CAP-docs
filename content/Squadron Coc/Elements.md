Elements are a sub-grouping of cadets under a flight. A flight usually has 2-4 elements, led by element leaders. 

The job of an element leader is a leader to their flight. Element leaders should be the first person an element member turns to if they have a question or a <u>small</u> concern. Element leaders should motivate their element and make sure they are doing what they are supposed to.
